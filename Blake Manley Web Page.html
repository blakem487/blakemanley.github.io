<U>Basics of Training</U>
</H3>
       <p> <b>Dog training</b> is a very useful tool. You can make money training other dogs, or you can just train your own dog to be a great companion. The training itself takes alot of time and effort, but it is very rewarding. Common misconceptions are that teaching tricks is the main thing. This isn't at all the case. Your dog knowing how to shake hands won't help much at all when he or she is about to run in the middle of the road. Rather in this situation, a common come back command would work much better than any trick ever would.   </p>

<U>Commands to Teach</U>
</H3>
       <P> As mentioned above, tricks are far less important than obedience commands. The commands that should be taught to a dog are as follows: <MARK>come, stay, drop it, no, place, and off</MARK>. These commands will be essential to your dog, and in some situations like above it could save your dogs life!

</H3>
       <P> Training can be a main source of income for you as well. Many people make a good living ogg of simply training dogs. A common table with some prices are listed below. When looking at the prices keep in mind that the trainer would be feeding, grooming, traing, excersing the dog, etc. There is so much mopre that goes into dog training than the average person knows! Training sessions can be pricey, but also very worth it. You never know how well your money was spent on your dog until you are in a life altering situation and a simple command and obeyance of the dog turns the situation completely around.
